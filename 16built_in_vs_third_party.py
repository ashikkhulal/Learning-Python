# python comes only with a set of built-in modules
# however, there are many more modules out there, which are not part of the python installation like web development, -
# - data science, machine learning and such
# you need to install these third-party packages
# build-in modules and packages are most common ones
# depending on what application you write, add specific ones
# python has pypi(python module library) where you can install python packages
# module is a python file whereas package is a collection of modules
# pypi is a repository(storage) for third-party python packages
# people can publish their packages to this repository
# so it becomes available for everyone to use (over 290,000 python packages)
# a large community means, many people are creating useful modules and make them available for others
# there is also a documentation on how to use and install packages: for example, pip install Django
# pip is a package manager for Python (pip is included in python installation)
# pip is used to install packages from the python package index, but also other indexes
# pip can also be used to uninstall items eg: pip uninstall Django
# in pycharm here, there is a python packages tab next to terminal tab to search and install packages
